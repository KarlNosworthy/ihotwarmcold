/**
 * The ESTBeacon class defines the interface for interacting with a single Estimote beacon. It enables you to retrieve properties of the beacon as well as alter its configuration settings. You do not create instances of this class directly. The ESTBeaconManager object reports encountered beacons to its associated delegate object.
 *
 * The identity of a beacon is defined by its proximityUUID, major, and minor properties. The combination of the three is required to be globally unique among all the Estimote beacons - a constraint that is being validated by the Estimote Cloud at the time of modifying any of these properties.
 *
 * The ESTBeacon instance is being populated with a different set of properties depending on which ESTBeaconManager's method was used to scan for and discover the beacon. There are two such methods currently:
 *
 * - startRangingBeaconsInRegion: - which is a CoreLocation based scan.
 *
 * - startEstimoteBeaconsDiscoveryForRegion: - which is a CoreBluetooth based scan.
 *
 * Additional properties become available once connected to the beacon. See connect for more details about connecting to the beacon. You will also need to assign a delegate to be notified about connection and disconnection events. The delegate needs to conform to the ESTBeaconDelegate protocol.
